		// command response. An alternative way of receiving the sensor's
		// latest measurements without the waiting for a query response, you
		// can configure the library to alert you when new asynchronous data
		// measurements are received. We will illustrate hooking up to our

		// connection baudrate. Here we will configure the binary output
		// register and process packets with a new callback method that can
