		// This example provides an overview of the UART protocol functionality
		// of the VectorNav .NET Library.
		//
		// Using the UART Protocol allows communicating with a VectorNav sensor
		// over a UART interface using both ASCII and binary protocols. Usage of
		// this "core" feature requires you to do all of the grunt work of
		// initializing and managing the UART port for your development
		// environment. Once this is set up, you will initialize the UART protocol
		// and then simply pass arrays of data between your UART code and the
		// VectorNav .NET Library's protocol code. To keep this example generic, we
		// will mock the necessary UART initialization and management functions
		// that would need to be replaced by code specific for your environment
		// to tie into a real VectorNav sensor. For now we just use some fake data
		// to illustrate the process.

		// The PacketFinder class encapsulates the data used for buffering and
		// handling incoming data. It is not associated with sending commands
		// to the sensor. Sending commands will be illustrated further in the
		// example.
		var pf = new PacketFinder();

		// Initialize the UART port (this is mimicked in this example).
		UserUart_Initialize();

		// Register our callback method to notification of when our PacketFinder
		// finds new data packets from our sensor.

		// port initialized, we will fake an asynchronous message output from
		// a VectorNav sensor and receive it from our mock UART port.

		// Normally you will be continually checking for new UART data and
		// then blindly passing any received data to the PacketFinder to build,
		// parse and verify data packets. Since this is just for demonstration
		// purposes, we just poll the mock UART for its current data. In a real

		// likely have a dedicated thread for checking the UART with code
